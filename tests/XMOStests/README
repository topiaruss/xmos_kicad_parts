Install
=======
This test project expects the library KiCad_Parts project to be cloned into
~/kicad/libs/ with the directory name topia. 

If you do that correctly, you should be able to see the file 

~/kicad/libs/topia/XS1-L1-64.lib, as well as many other files.

Then you should be able to open the test schematic and layout.
