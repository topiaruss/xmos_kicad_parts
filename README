Contains schematics and footprints for the XMOS XS1-L1 128 and 64 pin packages.

Footprints were inherited from other projects, and modified to include the thermal pads.

Schematics are fragmented in the same way as some XMOS reference designs.

If you prefer a different schematic layout, it is possible to derive new versions that share the same footprint.

If you find any issues, please report to the creator and maintainer: Russ Ferriday, russf@topia.com
